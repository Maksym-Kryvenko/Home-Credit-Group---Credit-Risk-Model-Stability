# Home Credit Default Risk - Credit Risk Model Stability

## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle competition on Home Credit Default Risk, focusing on Credit Risk Model Stability. The objective of the competition is to develop robust models that predict the likelihood of a client experiencing financial difficulties in repaying a loan.

## Competition Description

The competition is hosted by Home Credit, a leading global provider of consumer finance. The goal is to create a reliable credit scoring model to assess the risk of default for potential borrowers. By predicting the likelihood of repayment issues, Home Credit aims to make better-informed lending decisions and improve access to credit for a broader range of individuals.

## Repository Structure

- `input_data/`: Directory containing the datasets provided by Home Credit (due to the large size of data it can be reached via [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)).
- `home_credit_2024.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook showcasing the data exploration, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.
- `submissions/`: Final model predictions submitted to Kaggle.

## Requirements

- GPU (otherwise update the code with CPU instead)
